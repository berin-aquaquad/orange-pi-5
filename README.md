OPI5 open micro desktop case design.

(1/7/2023) New updated cad drawing. I got my RPI4 "ice tower cpu cooling fan" heatsink. I have done the CAD adjustments I need for it to be installed. At this point if anyone has interest in adjustments Please contact me.

This is an on going project and I'll be uploading updated cad draws as they are available and pictures of the latest adjustments. If anyone has a request please send me a message via twitter #Berinmoney I'll respond as time allows. When I get closer to a final version I'll add images showing dimentions.

This design was created using Designspark mechanical https://uk.rs-online.com/web/generalDisplay.html?id=designspark%2Fdesignspark-mechanical 
I have not build the design yet asof 12/31/2022 nor have I added locations for all of the missing I/O to the shell. Infact I just finished building the cad model. I have currently left it as an open canvas design. The shell its self can be modified if so desired to be a mono body. Currently its designed as a split body to be able to be printed on smaller 3d printers. The outside covers left and right are acrylic. The Mount that the OPI5 mounts to is acrylic as well. This design expects the two side panels and the sbc mount panel to be 3d printed or cnc cut or laser cut. The rest of the shell is to be 3d printed. Enjoy and please tag me as the original designer. 
FYI I'm looking for details on the OPI5. The OPI5 has an onboard RTC real time clock. and there are two test pads next to it one "grd1" the other "RTC1". That MUST be for a battery backup. I can find no details on what kind of a battery setup is needed. According to the schematic "RTC1" will be HOT with 5v DC when the SBC is running. What battery setup may be used on this? Any help would be wonderful.
