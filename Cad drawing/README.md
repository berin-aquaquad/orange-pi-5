An RSDOC file is the custom CAD file format for DesignSpark. It's a full 3d file format. Designspark is very powerful CAD software that is also free and on par with fusion360. 

The OPI5 mainboard in my cad drawing should be 99.9% accurate with all of the "headers" and ports that are relative to this desktop tower build currently.

The cad drawing expects metal or plastic 5mm tall threaded standoffs for the OPI5

The HDMI port on the back is expecting a ribbon cable extension HDMI adapter, amazon sells them places like that.

I need to find out what all of the features of the audio jack are before I adjust or add a standard short extension and screw tensioner port for audio.

I will add links to products if people do not have them on hand as time goes on.
