An RSDOC file is the custom CAD file format for DesignSpark. Its a full 3d file format.

The cad drawing expects metal or plastic 5mm tall threaded standoffs for the OPI5

The HDMI port on the back is expecting a ribbon cable HDMI adapter, amazon sells em places like that.

I need to find out what all of the features of the audio jack are before a just add a standard short extension and screw port for audio.
