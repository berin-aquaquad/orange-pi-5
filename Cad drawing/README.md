# I plan to rearrange the GIT a bit to make it a little more orginized.

# I have updated the cad draw and stl files for the OPI5 micro desktop as of 1/22/2023 the cad drawing should be final first version. Any changes after this will be feature changes and have there own sub folder for front half and back half of the split body OPI5 Micro Desktop. 

# KEY NOTE! I have elected to use two standoff types to mount the OPI5 and the rpi heatsink. The opi5 standoff is a 6mm with male thread standoff, the heatsink standoff uses a full female 10mm standoff. The 6mm male standoff is screwed into the 10mm standoff through the four OPI5 mount holes. To remove the OPI5 from the shell you have two choices, remove the screws from the backside to release the OPI5 keeping the standoff setup intact on the opi5. The other option is to remove the screws from the mount plane that screws to the OPI5 Micro Desktop from the right hand (backside) side. Removeing the OPI5 in this manner will leave the OPI5 attached to the mounting back plane.

An RSDOC file is the custom CAD file format for DesignSpark. It's a full 3d file format. Designspark is very powerful CAD software that is also free and on par with fusion360. 

The OPI5 mainboard in my cad drawing should be 99.9% accurate with all of the "headers" and ports that are relative to this desktop tower build currently.

The HDMI port on the back is expecting a ribbon cable extension HDMI adapter, amazon sells them places like that.

I need to find out what all of the features of the audio jack are before I adjust or add a standard short extension and screw tensioner port for audio.

I will add links to products if people do not have them on hand as time goes on.

# The GCODE folder contains files for the aluminum heatsink standoff and the mounting brackets for the heatsink. The micro desktop V1 folder contains the core micro desktop files for 3d printing or editing the two halfs for personal needs. Please give me credit on the design thanks.
