# Mind numbing fixes, adjusted the LCD mount measuring directly. The amazon source measurment files were way way way off. Some how I got the foot print for the RTC battery backup wrong way under sized. Male female coupler for the front/back of the case just dont mesh together so increased the size difference male/female. I'll do a cut down test print for them before I do my next .... test ... print. I believe at this point the latest files I posted should be the first really accurate version.

These are the core desktop cad files. The STL files are ready for printing and seperated. If someone wants to modify the shell halfs, the master cad file is in the orange-pi-5
/ Cad drawing directory. Files in this folder are the core shell files only.
