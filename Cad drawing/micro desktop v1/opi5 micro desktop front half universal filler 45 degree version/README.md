This is a custom front half of the OPI5 shell that has a universal insert located in the 45 degree area of the case. There is a blank filler and one that uses the i2c LCD. The lcd designed for is this one https://www.amazon.com/dp/B076WXR8N9 "i2c OLED Display 0.96 Inch" The pinout is part of the cad drawing.

The blank filler can be modified for anything custom, I did design the filler with the idea of using brass thread inserts with 2.5mm screws.
