The TAP file is a GCODE file of the heatsink block. If anyone has a cnc machine that can mill aluminum. This file expects a 1/8th milling bit, it expects a block of aluminum 12mm or .5" thick. The top of the tooling material is prob to zero. The tool path will mill below the thickness/depth of the stock during the two hole milling cycles and the final cut out. Account for those actions, the feed rate is 20mm/min.

The .E10 file is an ESTLcam file. I love ESTLcam, everything about it is easy. There are a few areas I'm not a fan of but that could have been designed different but I can work with it.
It does have some small issues and there is a bug in the coding that has to do with standard/metric units option-settings. I've asked the creater manytimes only to be brushed off. As long as the software options settings are correct on the UI everything is accurate. The problem is a "rounding" issue to the .xxx point rounding up. so... .005 would be rounded upto .01. You can see the issue with gcode output in regards to a tooling path and bit size.
